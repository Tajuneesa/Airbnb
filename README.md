# Airbnb
Response:
In analyzing the Airbnb dataset, I followed a structured data cleaning and transformation process to prepare the data for analysis. Below are the steps I took, along with the challenges I encountered and how I addressed them:

1. Initial Inspection:
o After loading the dataset, I performed an initial inspection to understand its structure, including the data types, missing values, and the summary statistics of the numerical columns. This step highlighted some key issues that needed to be addressed, such as mixed data types and missing values.
2. Dropping Unwanted Columns:
o I dropped unnecessary columns (id, host id, country, country code) to streamline the dataset and focus on the most relevant features for the analysis.
3. Handling Missing Values:
o I checked for missing values in the dataset and used appropriate methods to blame them. For categorical columns, such as room_type and neighborhood, I filled in missing values with the mode (the most frequent value). For numerical columns like price and service_fee, I used the median to fill in missing data, as it is robust to outliers.
4. Removing Duplicates:
o The dataset contained 3,461 duplicate records, which I removed to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the analysis. This reduced the number of entries, allowing for a cleaner and more precise dataset.
Data Transformation:
1. Renaming and Formatting Columns:
o I renamed the availability_365 column to days_booked to reflect its content better. Additionally, I converted all column names to lowercase and replaced spaces with underscores for consistency and ease of use in analysis.
Filter the DataFrame for Strict Cancellation Policy:
The code filters the DataFrame df to include only the rows where the cancellation_policy is 'strict'. This subset of the DataFrame is stored in df_group_two.
Count the Occurrences of Each Room Type:
The code then counts the number of occurrences of each room_type within the filtered data frame. This helps identify which room type is most associated with a strict cancellation policy.
Challenges Encountered:
1. Mixed Data Types:
o One of the challenges was dealing with the dtype Warning, indicating mixed data types in some columns. This was particularly evident in the price and service_fee columns, where currency symbols caused these columns to be interpreted as strings. I resolved this by stripping out the symbols and converting the columns to numeric types using pd.to_numeric().
2. Data Size and Performance:
o The large dataset size occasionally led to performance issues, especially during complex operations like correlation analysis and visualizations. To mitigate this, I optimized the code by using efficient pandas functions and, when necessary, working with a sample of the data before applying the final operations to the entire dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
1. Summary Statistics:
o I calculated basic statistics for the numerical columns, such as mean, median, and standard deviation. This provided insights into the distribution of the data, including skewness in features like number_of_reviews and days_booked.
2. Visualizations:
o I created visualizations to explore the distribution of prices and the relationship between price and days_booked. These plots helped identify patterns, such as the skewed distribution of prices and the correlation between booking days and room prices.
3. Correlation Analysis:
o I examined the correlations between numerical features using a heatmap. This analysis revealed exciting relationships, such as a positive correlation between calculated_host_listings_count and days_booked, suggesting that hosts with more listings tend to have higher booking rates.

Conclusion:
The data cleaning and transformation process was essential in preparing the Airbnb dataset for a robust analysis. I systematically addressed the challenges and ensured the data was accurate, consistent, and ready for insightful analysis. This process yielded more reliable and meaningful results, providing valuable insights into Airbnb's services and operations.
